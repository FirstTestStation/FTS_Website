## Interconnect IO Board Electrical Schematic   {#IO-schematic}

The Electrical Schematic of the InterconnectIO Board is located on github [IO-SCH](https://github.com/dlock8/InterconnectIO_Board/blob/main/InterconnectIO_bd/DOC/Interconnect_schematic.pdf).

## Interconnect IO Board Assembly Diagram   {#IO-assembly}

The Assembly Diagram for the InterconnectIO Board is located on github [IO-ASS](https://github.com/dlock8/InterconnectIO_Board/blob/main/InterconnectIO_bd/DOC/Interconnect_assembly.pdf). Our prototype version will not include surface mount components, instead we will replace them with an electronic module already mounted. Uninstalled resistors are marked with an X over the footprint.

## SelfTest Board Electrical Schematic   {#Self-schematic}

The Electrical Schematic of the Selftest Board is located on github [SELF-SCH](https://github.com/dlock8/Selftest_Board/blob/main/selftest_bd/DOC/selftest_schematic.pdf).
