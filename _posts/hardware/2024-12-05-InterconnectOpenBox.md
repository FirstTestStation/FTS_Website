## Features

•	 The InterconnectIO board is mounted in a low-cost molded ABS rackmount box (rackmount bracket not shown in the image). <br>
•	 The front and back panels are laser-cut from plywood. <br>
•	 Custom-designed guide rails (3d printed) are included to help the operator easily insert and remove the board, featuring push and pull handles on top of the guide rails. <br>
•	The project is powered by an external 5V power pack <br>
