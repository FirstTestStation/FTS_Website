## Purpose  

The primary objective of the SelfTest Test Plan is to conduct a series of tests, known as Test Steps, to verify the functionality of the hardware and software components that are part of the First TestStation.  

In the case of First TestStation, the OpenTAP software solution enables fast and easy development and execution of automated tests.  

In OpenTAP environments, the Test Step sequences are grouped in the same file with the `.TapPlan` extension.  

Because the hardware component of the First TestStation is not always present, different Test Plans have been created to accommodate this variation.  


## How  

The test strategy for creating the Test Plan has been documented in two documents:  

- **Test method diagram** to validate the hardware of the InterconnectIO Box:  
  [Selftest_Strategy.pdf](https://github.com/FirstTestStation/First_TestStation/pdf/Selftest_Strategy.pdf)  

- **Step-by-Step List of tests** to perform to complete the validation:
