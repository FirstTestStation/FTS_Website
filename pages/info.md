My first job in electronics, was electronic technicians for <a href= "https://shop.heathkit.com/shop">Heathkit</a>, repairing kit not working after be assembled by the customer. I have learned how to debug electronics by visual inspection to find reverse components, wrong components, missing component and bad soldering. <br>

My first role in electronics was as an electronic technician for Heathkit, repairing kits that didn't work after they were assembled by the customer.I have learned how to debug electronics mainly by visual inspection to find reverse components, wrong components, missing component and bad soldering.<br>

After a year of experience, I moved to bigger company as electronic technician to repair electronics instruments like multimeter, power supply, oscilloscope, etc. Through this job, I learned how to debug electrical problems with instruments and how to read an electrical schematic.<br>

As a hobby, at home, I was building a computer, based on the microprocessor Motorola 6802.
It teaches me how to design electronic circuits, how to wirewrap assemblies, and how to program in machine language. I had to learn how to investigate embedded software bugs on electronics circuits (is it a hardware issue or a software problem).<br>

After eight years in electronics as a technician, I decided to go back to school to become an engineer. As a junior engineer, my first job was split between a design engineer and a production support engineer.<br>

When we expanded our contract manufacturing business, I became a full-time production engineer in charge of test development and production support. I was alone on this job and I have trained myself to become test engineer using reading and internet website.<br>

Being a contract manufacturer, I was exposed to many test setup designs by our customers and I was designing test stations for them as well.  I learned that complex setup demands a great deal of support from test engineers and heavy maintenance.<br>
